h1. THE README

This is a project designed to simplify the way java developers interact with the Gilt API.

With this project a developer should be easily able to deserialize a response from the api into pojo's with a few lines of code.  

Many Java platforms have their own API for making http requests.  In my case it was the difference between Android and Google App Engine.  I choose to remove this component and let you maintain the finite control over the requests while this package deals with mapping the response data into business objects.
